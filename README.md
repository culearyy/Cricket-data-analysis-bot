1.Introduction
Cricket, a sport celebrated globally, requires strategic planning and data-driven decision-making for team selection. Identifying the best-performing players for a tournament like the ICC Champions Trophy involves analyzing various performance metrics, including batting averages, strike rates, bowling economy, and wicket counts. Traditionally, team selection relies on selectors' judgment, which, although backed by experience, may be subjective and prone to biases. The growing availability of extensive cricket data opens opportunities to apply computational techniques for objective and evidence-based selection.
This research proposes a Player Performance Analysis System that utilizes Matplotlib for visual representation and Python (Pandas) for data manipulation. Unlike conventional methods, the system leverages machine learning algorithms, specifically K-means clustering, to segment and rank players based on their performance data. Additionally, the project incorporates a Large Language Model (LLM) with Natural Language Processing (NLP) capabilities to analyze qualitative data, such as player health reports, match summaries, and recent form analysis. This 







combination ensures a comprehensive evaluation of players, considering both quantitative and qualitative factors.

The system's ability to analyze historical performance data and provide clear visual insights empowers coaches, selectors, and analysts to make informed decisions. Through dynamic visualizations using Matplotlib, users can compare player performances, identify trends, and predict future performance potential. Moreover, integrating health parameters using LLM ensures that the recommended playing XI consists of not only top-performing but also physically fit players, thereby reducing injury risks during tournaments.
By employing a robust data analysis pipeline, the proposed system reduces human error and enhances decision-making accuracy. This research contributes to the growing field of sports analytics, showcasing how advanced technologies can transform cricket management. The subsequent sections of this paper provide an overview of related work, system design, implementation methodology, results analysis, and conclusions drawn from the study.

This section outlines the core components used in building the system, including programming languages, libraries, machine learning techniques, and visualization tools. 
1.  Data Processing and Management
The project relies on Python as the primary programming language due to its extensive support for data analytics and machine learning. The Pandas library is used for data manipulation, enabling efficient handling of large datasets provided by the user. Data pre-processing techniques such as cleaning, feature extraction, and normalization ensure that the input data is structured and ready for analysis. Additionally, NumPy is employed for numerical operations to optimize computational performance. 
2.  Machine Learning and Player Clustering
A key component of this system is K-means clustering, implemented using Scikit-learn, to group players based on their performance metrics. This clustering technique helps categorize players into different skill levels, making it easier to filter and identify top performers. The choice of K-means is motivated by its efficiency in handling multidimensional data and its ability to uncover hidden patterns in player statistics, such as batting strike rate, bowling economy, and overall match impact. 
3.  Natural Language Processing and LLM Integration
To enhance player evaluation beyond numerical data, the project incorporates a Large Language Model (LLM)  trained to analyze player health parameters and qualitative performance reports. Using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, the LLM processes textual data related to injury records, fitness assessments, and match commentary. This integration ensures that the system not only selects top-performing players but also accounts for their physical fitness and readiness for tournaments.
